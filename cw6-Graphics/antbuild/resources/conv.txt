In mathematics and, in particular, functional analysis, convolution is
a mathematical operation on two functions f and g, producing a third
function that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the
original functions, giving the integral of the pointwise multiplication
of the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original
functions is translated. Convolution is similar to cross-correlation.
It has applications that include probability, statistics, computer vision,
natural language processing, image and signal processing, engineering, and
differential equations.

The convolution can be defined for functions on groups other than Euclidean space.
For example, periodic functions, such as the discrete-time Fourier transform,
can be defined on a circle and convolved by periodic convolution.
A discrete convolution can be defined for functions on the set of integers.
Generalizations of convolution have applications in the field of numerical
analysis and numerical linear algebra, and in the design and implementation
of finite impulse response filters in signal processing.

Computing the inverse of the convolution operation is known as deconvolution.
